    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p> Obiamaka is a second year student in the Master of City Planning program at DUSP! My viszualization is a piece called, Good Luck With That Wall. It is a video edit of 200,000 images stitched together illustrating the geography of the U.S. Mexico border. The film visualization and the accompanying article can be found <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/10/26/best-of-luck-with-the-wall/">here.</a></p>
